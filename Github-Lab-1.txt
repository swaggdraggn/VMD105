Github Lab 1: Collaboration

Instructions: In this lab we will play a game of literary ‘exquisite corpse’. The idea is we will write a story where each student writes one paragraph of the story based on the last paragraph. 

For this assignment please edit this file by opening it into a text program like TextEdit / Microsoft Word. Please keep the story PG. No use of cursing, racism, sexist, homophobia, intense graphic violence imagery, overt sexual speech will be tolerated. When you start your paragraph please write your name at the top.

When you are done with the paragraph please separate your section by using the a line of underscores. You can do this by holding shift + hypen (-)

Once the darkness of space closed around her, the gorilla named Esme, desperately hoped to time travel.  Her native city of San Francisco no longer seemed a friendly place for a female gorilla, despite the fact that Diane Fossey of “Gorillas in the mist” graduated from Lowell - the most despised, yet respected high school in San Francisco.  But, thought Esme to herself, so did Daniel Handler, and we all know how happy he turned out to be.

Soon, Esme became extremely useful to the alien crew. Her ability to multitask using both hands and feet amazed them!

They realized that they were close to Venus but there was some problems with the engine, so the alien could not turn around.
